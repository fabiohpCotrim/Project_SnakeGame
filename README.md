## Soul Eater
A small personal Java project, putting together the all time all famous Snake game and Dark Souls, one of my favourite games ever. 

Includes "pause" and "resume" functions, as well as a "restart" method, implemented so you can actually play the game more than once, **because we know Snake is pretty addictive.**
